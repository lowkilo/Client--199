# OpenOSRS injected RuneLite for Salem

[![Build Status](https://github.com/open-osrs/runelite/workflows/OpenOSRS%20-%20CI%20(push)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/open-osrs/runelite/actions?query=workflow%3A%22OpenOSRS+-+CI+%28push%29%22)

[OpenOSRS](https://openosrs.com) is a fully open-source client with no restrictions. We are not affiliated with Jagex or RuneLite.  
  
This is a special branch that uses the upstream client (RuneLite) with the OpenOSRS injector. (bundled)  

From the root module, run the following gradle tasks:  
```clean build run```
  
This branch is still in bringup but most functionality works as intended.  
This branch uses upstreams PlayerManager/OverlayManager etc so keep that in mind if porting a plugin.  
  
Contributions are welcome, but there should be no changes made to runelite-client unless necessary/minor. Mould the api around the client.

## How to setup
* First clone this repository
* Open it in Intellij (Or what ever IDE you have)
  * Make sure to use JDK 11
* Wait for it to fully load
* You should see Gradle button on your right side by default open that tab
* Expand OpenOSRS -> Tasks -> openosrs -> (Right click) on run -> and choose modify run configuration
* Inside Run textarea copy and paste: `run --args="--developer-mode --debug --jav_config "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlterRSPS/Runelite/master/jav_config.ws"" -x checkStyleMain -x checkStyleTest -x test`
* Apply and Done now couple times press on that run task in gradle tab
* When the client fully loads you should see: `You have to change the Key(Modulus) to RSPS that you wish to connect. After it loads and you changed the Key just re-enable the Private Server plugin.`
* Click ok and go to plugins menu search for Private Server click the settings icon enter your RSA Key that you received from your server when doing install process.
  * In case you lost the RSA Key: Just do install task in your server to gain new RSA Key.
* Disable and Enable the private server plugin and done you can login.


* Side note: make sure your server is running. Otherwise, the clients screen will be black.
